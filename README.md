# Python Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naïve Bayes algorithm is used to predict the classification of messages within a collection given a predefined set of category labels. The data consists of 1,000 messages within each of 20 categories with names related to content subject, such as “alt.atheism” and “rec.autos”. The sub-directory names are used as the category labels for the training and prediction algorithms. The first 500 messages of each category are used for training while the remaining messages are marked as prediction test data. To benchmark the accuracy of the classification algorithm, the percentage of correct predictions is calculated using the predicted and actual category labels of the test data. The algorithm is approximately 86.10% accurate when predicting message categories.
